Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule download_articles in file /user/home/nu24390/covid_project/Snakefile, line 1:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/pmids.xml (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
data/articles (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
